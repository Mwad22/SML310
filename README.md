### Project Proposal
There are a few other approaches for providing recommendations beyond the
traditional collaborative and content-based filtering architectures for recommendation
systems. Some have received increasingly growing attention in research and industry,
while others that remain relatively unexplored. Examples of techniques that fall in the
former category are those that involve Deep Learning (usually relying upon neural
networks), and have proved a helpful tool to improve upon the short-comings of the
more traditional recommender system techniques. Meanwhile, an example of a
technique that falls in the latter category would be the recent experimental efforts to use
the stochastic process known as random walks to provide recommendations. In this
paper, I wish to first explore the performance of basic content-based and collaborative
recommendation systems on MovieLens 100k dataset, highlight their advantages and
disadvantages, and compare them with a neural network-based recommendation
system.
